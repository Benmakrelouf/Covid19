# Covid19
# The code makes it possible to model the final situation of a set of COVID patients in Algeria.
# Using a logistic model we obtain an estimate of the model of the final situation of COVID patients.
# Finally one can have the estimated probabilities of death or survival of a patient.
# By using an on-line database, the model can be adjusted to eventually be used in a sorting software in a hospital emergency department.
